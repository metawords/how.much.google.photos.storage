Google Photos has offered unlimited storage for the last five years, but that support is ending in 2021, meaning you may need to watch how much you have setting in your Google account.

On June 1, 2021, the company will switch off its free unlimited storage for Google Photos and instead the images you upload from that date will count toward the 15GB of storage that comes free with your Google account.

That's also the space that you'll be using to backup documents through Google Drive and other Google services, so even if you haven't been using your 15GB for images, you may find you're almost out of space.

## How to check how much space you have left


This is a relatively easy step, and you'll need your device that is signed into your Google account to be able to do so. That may be your Android phone, iPhone or your computer.

Open the Google Photos app, and you'll be greeted with the latest photos you've taken and a variety of other elements such as photos from previous years.

Press on the top right hand corner (where your Google Account image is) and you'll see your personal account. Below that, you'll see a section that runs you through your Account Storage, and tells you exactly how much you have left to use.

It'll give you a warning message with how much you've got left, and if you're seeing a lot of the color red you'll be nearing your maximum limit of Google Photos storage. It'll give you a figure accurate to 0.1GB to tell you have much space you have left too.

Press on this section, and you'll be greeted with further information. Some also get an estimate of how much longer that 15GB of storage will last (some of our testing has found this doesn't work on all devices) to give you an idea of how much longer you can use this.

Remember, you can continue uploading photos until June 1 without it counting toward this cap. This may mean you want to take a look through your Google cloud storage to see where you can trim some of the fat though, or maybe you'd wish to switch to another cloud storage platform instead.
